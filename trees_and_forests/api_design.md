# API Design

Here is the roadmap of building this library:

1. Build the tree
2. Extend the tree

## 1. Building the tree

Minimum viable tree:
- ...
- ...
- ...

### Step 1: Add manually

### Step 2: Run inference

### Step 3: Add programmatically with no recursion

### Step 4: Add programmatically

Stack
TreeNode

We want to avoid recursive programming while building the tree as it might cause stackoverflow.

## 2. Extend the tree

- X.ndim = Multi-dimension
- X.ndim = 1D
- Refactor gini
- Categorical
- Fix dim
- Predict categorical
- Thresholding
- Max depth
- Select features
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- Boosted trees
- Gradient boosted trees

## 3. Throughout

- Go for small but quick gains
- Refactor
- Naming

## 4. Tools

- VS Code
- IPython interpreter
- IPython debugger (like Python debugger, but better)
